            <p>Before the Storm Earth, the third planet from the Sun, was a blue-and-green jewel in the cosmic void.
                People, oblivious to the impending catastrophe, lived lives of joy, despair, and everything in-between.
                There was love, strife, and ambition, set against a backdrop of verdant fields, towering cities, and
                restless oceans. Cherry blossoms bloomed in spring, a spectacle of beauty and transience that defined
                the rhythm of life on Earth. But all that changed on the Day of the Red Sky.</p>
